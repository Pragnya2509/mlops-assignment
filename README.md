# MLSE Lab Assignment 4 – CI/CD with DVC & GitHub Actions  

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to extend our ML pipeline (developed in Assignment 3) by adding **CI/CD automation**.  
We will integrate **GitHub Actions** with **DVC** so that:  
- Code, data, and experiments are tracked reproducibly.  
- The pipeline (`preprocess → train → evaluate`) runs automatically on GitHub Actions.  
- Metrics and plots are updated on every push.
